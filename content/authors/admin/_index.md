I am a Undergraduate at FuDan university,major in Nuclear Engineering and Technology.  I work hard and achieve nice grade , 3.44 of 4.0, rank 6 of 34. I love physics and achieve A level grade in most physical courses. 

I am interested in  cold atom physics and condensed matter theory ,also concerned about quantum many-body problem .

I have two research experience, one of is CMS machine learning science project at Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In this project, I apply machine learning to analyse jets data from CEPC, Circular Electron Positron Collider. I build Particle Flow Network to classify Z bosons decay mode, and the accuracy reach 95%. Then I use train result to provide new method to measure R value, an important value in particle physics, and I finally get error about 10e-9.

Another project is to calculate the energy and wave function of multiple Harmonic oscillators with interaction.I suppose the interaction is delta function and only concern  the relative motion. I am applying  Generate Coordinate Method (a method from nuclear many body problem) to calculate 2、3、4、5、6 body problem and  the ground energy  is expected to be  very consistent with other methods. Remarkably, In GCM I just use Gaussian function as my trial wave function,so this method can be easily generalized to more bodies.
